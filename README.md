# InformationCellularAutomata
A model of information flow in one dimensional Cellular Automata.

Demonstrates that finite one dimensional cellular automaton can be respresented by a graph data structure and demonstrates some simple rules for passing information between nodes equivilant to the information passed between cells in a cellular automata.
